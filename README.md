# RESTAPI_Assignments
This repository contains all of my REST API Assignments &amp; Projects

server.js contains GET & POST API implementations for adding, subtracting, dividing and multiplying two numbers. It has in-function input validation as well as a global validation via a middle-ware (validate.js) which checks for a specific token in the request header.
